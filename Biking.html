        According to Bob Allen, Mountain Bike Hall of Famer and founding board member of the Montana Mountain Bike Alliance,<br> Butte has around 300 miles of mountain-bike-legal singletrack in the immediate area.<br> The singletrack opportunities are incredibly diverse,<br> too. “There are trails and a bike park of sorts on the west side of the Montana Tech Campus,” said Bob.<br> “The trails climb up to ‘The Butte’, the high point with a giant lighted ‘M’ above town.” <br>
<br><br>
        In addition to the singletrack that’s easily accessible from town,<br> backcountry trails extend into the mountains all around the area.<br> “The CDT in both directions from Homestake Pass on Interstate 90 are worthy out-and-backs, or part of a larger point-to-point or loops,” said Bob.<br> If you want to shuttle up to the CDT and ride all the way back into town, Linked Adventures is the company to contact for shuttles.<br> If you want to get even more adventurous, of course there’s always bikepacking, but Linked Adventures also does supported multi-day rides on the Continental Divide Trail.</p>

            with over 200 miles of singletrack within 25 miles of downtown, there’s so, so much more to be ridden!<br> Charlie Morgan, Knoxville local and freelance writer for Singletracks.com,<br> recommends checking out “Barn Burner at Baker’s Creek (Devil’s Racetrack for experts), South Loop, Ross Marble, Flow at Mead’s Quarry, and Lost Chromosome at Fork of The River WMA.” 
        <br><br>
        he Windrock Bike Park is also located within 25 miles of Knoxville and boasts super steep, burly DH runs built and managed by none other than pro downhiller Neko Mulally.<br><br>

        Yeah, maybe you never considered Knoxville a mountain bike town before…<br> but it’s time to change your perspective! Defining Knoxville as a “town” is a bit tricky, and with a population of 186,000 (869,000 in the greater metro area), this is the highest-populated “town” on our list.<br> But if you’re attracted to the accessibility of big city amenities like retail, restaurants, and a reasonably-sized airport, Knoxville could be the best choice on our list. That, and you can’t argue with the cost of living numbers. 
<br><br>
        The COL index is 81.40–the lowest number on our list.<br> The median home price of $136,000 isn’t the absolute lowest on this list, but for a relatively large city it’s pretty impressive.<br> That said, the market is pretty hot in Knoxville right now, and Zillow notes that the median price of homes listed for sale is $209,900. Knoxville is clearly on the rise.
