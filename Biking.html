        According to Bob Allen, Mountain Bike Hall of Famer and founding board member of the Montana Mountain Bike Alliance,<br> Butte has around 300 miles of mountain-bike-legal singletrack in the immediate area.<br> The singletrack opportunities are incredibly diverse,<br> too. “There are trails and a bike park of sorts on the west side of the Montana Tech Campus,” said Bob.<br> “The trails climb up to ‘The Butte’, the high point with a giant lighted ‘M’ above town.” <br>
        <br><br>
                In addition to the singletrack that’s easily accessible from town,<br> backcountry trails extend into the mountains all around the area.<br> “The CDT in both directions from Homestake Pass on Interstate 90 are worthy out-and-backs, or part of a larger point-to-point or loops,” said Bob.<br> If you want to shuttle up to the CDT and ride all the way back into town, Linked Adventures is the company to contact for shuttles.<br> If you want to get even more adventurous, of course there’s always bikepacking, but Linked Adventures also does supported multi-day rides on the Continental Divide Trail.</div>
